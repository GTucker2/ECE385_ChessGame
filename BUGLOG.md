## Foreword
### Formatting

Bugs are to be reported with a description covering the general misoperation as well as the file and function they appear in if known. In
addition, the date the bug is found on as well as the date the bug is resolved should be recorded. Upon resolution, the solution to the 
problem should be noted. Report authors are to be credited. 

The following serves as an example as to how bug reports are to be formatted for this project:

```
F: 11_09_2017 : Griffin A. Tucker,
R: 11_09_2017 : Lance Pan,
   main.c; main(),
   For loop runs indefinitely. Iterator never updates,
   Adjusted iterator to increment with every cycle.
```
